Looking for a project to join
I maybe want to support a team making something other than the food hub project, depending on what folks come up with.

Topics:
maybe a program that compares prices for different items for sale on websites
Data scraping, maybe from websites like twitter, insta etc. could possibly scape and download/archive  photos from certain accounts 
Games
Cyber security

Open to taking on any aspect of a coding team project really, trying to learn :)
